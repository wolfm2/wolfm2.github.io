    <div id="title"> The New Jim Crow </div>
    
    <div id="intro">
    In the five decades since African Americans won their civil rights, hundreds of
thousands have lost their liberty. Blacks now make up a larger portion of the prison
population than they did at the time of Brown v. Board of Education, and their lifetime
risk of incarceration has doubled. As the United States has become the world’s largest
jailer and its prison population has exploded, black men have been particularly affected.
Today, black men are imprisoned at 6.5 times the rate of white men.
<br>
<br>
While scholars have long analyzed the connection between race and America’s
criminal justice system, an emerging group of scholars and advocates has highlighted the
issue with a provocative claim: They argue that our growing penal system, with its black
tinge, constitutes nothing less than a new form of Jim Crow. 
<br>
<br>
    Though I have not determined who first drew the analogy between today’s
criminal justice system and Jim Crow, a number of writers began using the term to
describe contemporary practices in the late 1990s. In 1999, for example, William
Buckman and John Lamberth declared:
<br>
<br>
Jim Crow is alive on America’s highways, trains and in its airports. Minorities are 
suspect when they appear in public, especially when they exercise the most basic and
fundamental freedom of travel. In an uncanny likeness to the supposedly dead Jim Crow
of old, law enforcement finds cause for suspicion in the mere fact of certain minorities in
transit. 
<br>
<br>
Buckman and Lamberth argued that racial profiling was a byproduct of the
nation’s strategy to combat drugs, and criticisms of the War on Drugs have remained
central to the Jim Crow analogy. That same year, in a widely-quoted speech to the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Executive Director Ira Glasser argued that
“drug prohibition has become a replacement system for segregation. It has become a
system of separating out, subjugating, imprisoning, and destroying substantial portions of
a population based on skin color.”

          "You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

 <br>
What did you think about this news from the Justice Department, saying they'll release about 6,000 non-violent drug offenders from federal prisons? <br>
 <br>
There needs to be something attached to that, to make sure these 6,000 people will return to housing; to make sure these 6,000 people will be able to get employment; to make sure these 6,000 people will be able to get their basic needs met, so that whoever it is will have a chance to integrate into society. <br>
 <br>
Do you have suggestions for new programs that would help people integrate into society better after they're released from prison? <br>
 <br>
What we found here, in Alameda County, is that [the prison system] has good programs, but they're underfunded by the counties and the state. One of the issues we're facing now is that we have education and employment service providers, but we're not subsidizing an individual's employment for long enough periods of time so that a person can stay on a job and learn the soft skills that he or she needs to maintain a job. If we're not directing more resources to finance those types of employment opportunities, they're not going to place a lot of people in employment.

    <!--http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/10/cory-booker/how-war-drugs-affected-incarceration-rates/ -->
    The state and federal prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent since 1974.<br>
The state and federal prison population remained fairly stable through the early 1970s, until the war on drugs began. Since then, it has increased sharply every year, particularly when Reagan expanded the policy effort in the 1980s, until about 2010.<br>
It is a well-established fact that minorities are overrepresented in the prison population. About 58 percent of all sentenced inmates in 2013 were black or hispanic, yet the two groups make up just about 30 percent of the total population. <br>
Research also suggests that when black and white people engage in the same illegal activity and have the same criminal history, black people are more likely to be arrested, more likely to face tougher charges and more likely to receive longer sentences than whites.

    Federal Inmates "realigned" to Local Facilities</div>
<!--https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-prison-budget-insight/california-prison-reforms-have-reduced-inmate-numbers-not-costs-idUSKBN0UK0J520160106 -->
<!--www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/local_news/the-monterey-county-jail-is-an-overcrowded-pit-of-violence/article_65f77467-346f-5bf7-9b9b-ca73b274d802.html -->

Prior to the 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which found that California’s overcrowded prisons violated the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, prisoners could languish in under-prepared local facilities for years.  <br> 
When a person gets arrested, the county jail traditionally houses them while they wait to be tried and convicted. If they get a sentence of more than one year they go to prison. Not so long ago, a vast majority of inmates in the county jail were in for minor crimes. Today that trend has been reversed. In Monterey County in 2005, 65 percent of the county jail’s inmates went to prison when tried and convicted. To complicate matters, the judicial process has slowed to a crawl. Some of the inmates waiting to be sentenced to long prison terms have been in the county jail for three years. <br>
<!--To make matters worse, the jail was designed with little practical knowledge and almost no foresight. It’s made up of 27 separate housing units, each tacked to the next in partially-funded bursts of administrative desperation over the last 36 years. <br>-->
Unfortunately, BOP data collection on transfers due specifically to overcrowding ceased in 1999.

    Felony Disenfranchisement Laws by State<br></div>
As of 2016, an estimated 6.1 million people are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction, a figure that has escalated dramatically in recent decades as the population under criminal justice supervision has increased. There were an estimated 1.17 million people disenfranchised in 1976, 3.34 million in 1996, and 5.85 million in 2010. <br>
Approximately 2.5 percent of the total U.S. voting age population – 1 of every 40 adults – is disenfranchised due to a current or previous felony conviction. <br>
Individuals who have completed their sentences in the twelve states that disenfranchise people post-sentence make up over 50 percent of the entire disenfranchised population, totaling almost 3.1 million people. <br>
Rates of disenfranchisement vary dramatically by state due to broad variations in voting prohibitions. In six states – Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia – more than 7 percent of the adult population is disenfranchised. <br>
The state of Florida alone accounts for more than a quarter (27 percent) of the disenfranchised population nationally, and its nearly 1.5 million individuals disenfranchised post-sentence account for nearly half (48 percent) of the national total.

African American disenfranchisement rates also vary significantly by state. In four states – Florida (21 percent), Kentucky (26 percent), Tennessee (21 percent), and Virginia (22 percent) – more than one in five African Americans is disenfranchised.<br>
