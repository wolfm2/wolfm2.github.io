    <div id="title"> The New Jim Crow </div>
    
    <div id="intro">
    In the five decades since African Americans won their civil rights, hundreds of
thousands have lost their liberty. Blacks now make up a larger portion of the prison
population than they did at the time of Brown v. Board of Education, and their lifetime
risk of incarceration has doubled. As the United States has become the world’s largest
jailer and its prison population has exploded, black men have been particularly affected.
Today, black men are imprisoned at 6.5 times the rate of white men.
<br>
<br>
While scholars have long analyzed the connection between race and America’s
criminal justice system, an emerging group of scholars and advocates has highlighted the
issue with a provocative claim: They argue that our growing penal system, with its black
tinge, constitutes nothing less than a new form of Jim Crow. 
<br>
<br>
    Though I have not determined who first drew the analogy between today’s
criminal justice system and Jim Crow, a number of writers began using the term to
describe contemporary practices in the late 1990s. In 1999, for example, William
Buckman and John Lamberth declared:
<br>
<br>
Jim Crow is alive on America’s highways, trains and in its airports. Minorities are 
suspect when they appear in public, especially when they exercise the most basic and
fundamental freedom of travel. In an uncanny likeness to the supposedly dead Jim Crow
of old, law enforcement finds cause for suspicion in the mere fact of certain minorities in
transit. 
<br>
<br>
Buckman and Lamberth argued that racial profiling was a byproduct of the
nation’s strategy to combat drugs, and criticisms of the War on Drugs have remained
central to the Jim Crow analogy. That same year, in a widely-quoted speech to the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Executive Director Ira Glasser argued that
“drug prohibition has become a replacement system for segregation. It has become a
system of separating out, subjugating, imprisoning, and destroying substantial portions of
a population based on skin color.”

          "You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

 <br>
What did you think about this news from the Justice Department, saying they'll release about 6,000 non-violent drug offenders from federal prisons? <br>
 <br>
There needs to be something attached to that, to make sure these 6,000 people will return to housing; to make sure these 6,000 people will be able to get employment; to make sure these 6,000 people will be able to get their basic needs met, so that whoever it is will have a chance to integrate into society. <br>
 <br>
Do you have suggestions for new programs that would help people integrate into society better after they're released from prison? <br>
 <br>
What we found here, in Alameda County, is that [the prison system] has good programs, but they're underfunded by the counties and the state. One of the issues we're facing now is that we have education and employment service providers, but we're not subsidizing an individual's employment for long enough periods of time so that a person can stay on a job and learn the soft skills that he or she needs to maintain a job. If we're not directing more resources to finance those types of employment opportunities, they're not going to place a lot of people in employment.
