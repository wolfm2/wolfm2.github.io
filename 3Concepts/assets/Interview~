What did you think about this news from the Justice Department, saying they'll release about 6,000 non-violent drug offenders from federal prisons?

There needs to be something attached to that, to make sure these 6,000 people will return to housing; to make sure these 6,000 people will be able to get employment; to make sure these 6,000 people will be able to get their basic needs met, so that whoever it is will have a chance to integrate into society.

Do you have suggestions for new programs that would help people integrate into society better after they're released from prison?

What we found here, in Alameda County, is that [the prison system] has good programs, but they're underfunded by the counties and the state. One of the issues we're facing now is that we have education and employment service providers, but we're not subsidizing an individual's employment for long enough periods of time so that a person can stay on a job and learn the soft skills that he or she needs to maintain a job. If we're not directing more resources to finance those types of employment opportunities, they're not going to place a lot of people in employment.
